# to fix...
1) KeyboardHook delegate garbage collecting (fixed)
2) Cannot re-show SettingsWindow when closed
  Solution: change borderstyle to none and make it moveble with custom "x" button to HIDE
  and not to close the window.

# to-do...
 Markup : - [ ] Settings Window
              - [x] be able to change ping hostname (done)
              - [ ] be able to pause and resume pinging
              - [ ] be able to change opacity of the MainWindow background
